                Stats are what determine one's physical and magical abilities which grows and recedes with one's age. On average 100 points are evenly distributed on birth, but you can distribute your stats however you like for 5 sp. Races will heavily influence stats on birth and stats growth as some are predisposed to gain or lose some of the stats.
